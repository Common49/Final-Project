# Kodland 2408 Hackathon

## Idea
My intial idea is to create a smple webpage that generates random climate facts for users to improve awareness of climate crisis around the world. Another feature that the website will have is a 'practice pronounciation' on more complex climate terms for those who would like to learn english. The website will also include certain tips or simple eco-friendly projects that users can do at home to fight against climate change.
