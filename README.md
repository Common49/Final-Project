# Final-Project Hackathon 2408

This is my final project for Kodland 2408. 

## Idea
My intial idea is to create a smple webpage that generates random climate facts for users to improve awareness of climate crisis around the world. Another feature that the website will have is to have a 'practice prnounciation' on more complex climate terms for those who would like to improve their english.
